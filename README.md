# git-experiments

Note: I wasn't able to find a partner, but I have done all of these things before 
and I feel confident in my ability to do them again. I am really sorry I didn't do
this assignment fully.

## Part 1

1. Cloned using git clone https://github.com/luciefwolf/git-experiments.git
2. Edited the README and created file "cool-new-file.txt"
3. Checked the file statuses using git status
4. Added both the new file and updated the README using git add .
5. Ensured it was added correctly using git status
6. Committed the changes to the README and cool-new-file using git commit -m "Added new file and updated README"
8. Again ensured that everything was correctly committed using git status
9. Pushed the changes using git push
10. Made sure that the changes appeared on GitHub


## Part 2/3
1. Created a new branch using git checkout -b CoolerFile
2. Added cooler-newer-file.txt
3. Added cooler-newer-file.txt to a new commit, using a series of git adds, git statuses, and a git commit
4. Pushed the branch and file using git push --set-upstream origin CoolerFile
